# Stroop Effect
> What is Stroop Effect? 

The **Stroop Effect** is a well-known psychological phenomenon where interference between conflicting features of a stimulus (e.g., word meaning and ink color) slows down response time or reduces accuracy.

The classic demonstration is the "Stroop Task": Participants are asked to name the ink color of a word (e.g., the word "BLUE" printed in red ink) while ignoring the word's meaning. Due to the mismatch between the word and its color, responses become slower or error-prone. This effect highlights cognitive interference in attention, inhibitory control, and automatic processing, making it a fundamental tool in psychology research.

## Program Introduction

This program tests your **Stroop effect**. You'll need to click the correct option **without interference**.

When the game starts, it will generate a question where the font color **differs** from the font content. Below it, four color options will appear for you to choose from.

If you select correctly, your score will **increase by one point**. If you select incorrectly, your score will **decrease by three points**. The game ends when your score reaches **20 points** or drops to **-10 points**.

This is just a brief introduction to the program; each page will be described in detail below.

## Program Installation

This program comes in three versions: an **.exe (executable file)**, an **.msi (Windows installer package)**, and a **.zip (compressed archive)**.

You can install it based on your needs. Usually, downloading the .exe or .msi version is sufficient.

During the download or installation process, your browser and system might flag the file as unsafe. Please don't worry about this; I can assure you that the program itself contains **no viruses or malicious content**.

The program is detected as unsafe because it **lacks a digital signature certificate**. <s>(Can't afford one)</s>

If you download the .exe or .msi version, simply **double-click** the program to run and install it.

If you download the .zip version, you'll need to **extract it** and then run the .exe file located inside the folder to get started.

1. Below the introduction, there's a light yellow "Start" button. Clicking this button will begin the game.

1. In the top-left corner of the start interface is a question mark button. Clicking this button will display a brief introduction to the Stroop Effect.

1. In the top-right corner of the start interface is the language switch button. Clicking this button allows you to switch languages.

### Game Interface

1.  Once you start the game, the program will enter an interface similar to this. Here, you'll see a **question**, four **square blocks**, a **button** in the top right corner, your **score** in the bottom left, and the **time** in the bottom right.

2.  In the top right corner of the game interface, there's a button with an "X" symbol. Clicking this button will immediately end the game and return you to the start interface.

3.  When the game begins, the program will randomly generate a color for the text and the text content, ensuring they are different.

    > As shown in the example image:
    > The program generated a question. The text content of the question is "Pink", while the color of the text itself is "Orange".

4.  Simultaneously, four randomly colored square blocks will appear below. These generated blocks will include both the color of the question's text content "Pink" and the color of the text itself "Orange".

    > According to the rules, you need to select the **color of the question's text content** from the square color blocks below. In this example, that would be "Pink", which is the third block. Choosing any other color will be counted as incorrect.

5.  Based on the rules, a correct selection adds one point, while an incorrect selection deducts three points. The game ends when your score reaches **20 points** or drops to **-10 points**, and an end-game window will pop up.
